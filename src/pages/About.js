            A film – also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture, photoplay or (slang) 
            flick – is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, 
            stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These 
            images are generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The
             word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often usedto refer to filmmaking and the film industry,
              and the art form that is the result of it.
